NOTE: Installation assumes apache, ssl, and php on a linux system.
Other setups may work fine.  This also assumes linux skills and root
access.  Afterall, let's face it, if your trying to set up a
chillispot access point, you're going to need these anyway.



1. untar the scripts wherever you want your secure webserver DocumentRoot.
For example:

$ mv wlogin.x.xx.tgz /home/mysite.com/ssl/.
$ cd /home/mysite.com/ssl
$ tar xvzf wlogin.x.xx.tgz
$ ln -s   wlogin.x.xx   wlogin

This will create:

/home/mysite.com/ssl/wlogin.x.xx
/home/mysite.com/ssl/wlogin.x.xx/site-doc
/home/mysite.com/ssl/wlogin.x.xx/site-lib

The symbolic link comes in handy when setting up apache.

All files in the tarball extract within these directories.



2. You should point your secure webserver's DocumentRoot to the
site-doc directory.  Following the example above:

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName wlogin.mysite.com
  DocumentRoot /home/mysite.com/wlogin/site-doc
  ServerAdmin admin@mysite.com
 
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/wlogin.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.key/wlogin.key
  SSLCACertificateFile /usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
 
  <Files ~ "\.(php3|php?)$">
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
  </Files>
 
  SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
         nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
         downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
</VirtualHost>



3. Edit ./wlogin/site-lib/config.inc to suit your setup.



4. Modify or create a new wlogin/site-doc/images/wireless_logo.png.  A
layered xcf file is included for gimp users!

Also, modify ./wlogin/site-doc/style/styles.css to suit your tastes.
Be sure to make it nice and ugly and specify really awful fonts that
only windows users could possibly have (with defualts for sans-serif
for the rest of us ;^b ).
